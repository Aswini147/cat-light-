1️⃣ *Switch Status Changes:*
 - The switch's status dynamically changes, indicating its current state - either ON or OFF.

2️⃣ *Bulb Goes On and Off:*

 During this c

During this challenge I utilized HTML DOM event listeners to orchestrate these interactions. When the switch is toggled, it triggers functions that update the status of the bulb, control the visibility of the cat, and modify the background color of the switch. This challenge served as a fantastic introduction to handling events, manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), and implementing logic in JavaScript.
